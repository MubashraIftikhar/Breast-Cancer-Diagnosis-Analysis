This repository contains a Streamlit application and supporting resources for breast cancer diagnosis prediction. The repository includes the Streamlit application code and a Jupyter notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and Logistic Regression modeling with a training accuracy of 96%.
## GUIDE TO BREAST CANCER PREDICTOR STREAMLIT APPLICATION
This Streamlit application provides an interactive platform to explore and predict breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. Below is a detailed guide to the applicationâ€™s structure and functionality:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

<b>Overview:</b> This page introduces the dataset and its attributes. It outlines the key characteristics of the features used in breast cancer analysis.

<b>Dataset Attributes:</b> Information about the various features, such as mean radius, mean texture, mean smoothness, etc., is provided to help users understand the dataset structure.

### 2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

<b>Visualizations:</b>

<b>Distribution Plots:</b> These plots show the distribution of benign and malignant cases, offering insights into the dataset's class balance.

<b>Scatter Plot and Pair Plot:</b>

A checkbox allows users to switch between scatter plots and pair plots.

Users can select features of interest to visualize relationships between attributes.

### 3. MODEL

<b>Feature Selection:</b> This section allows users to choose specific features for model training and testing.

<b>Prediction:</b> Users can input custom values for the selected features to test predictions and assess the model's performance on these inputs.

### 4. CONCLUSION

<b>Summary:</b> This page provides a summary of the analysis and the model's performance.

With this application, users can seamlessly explore the dataset, visualize important trends, and test machine learning models to predict breast cancer diagnoses interactively.
